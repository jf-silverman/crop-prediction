![Farmer in a field](farmer_in_a_field.jpg)

In this project, I built a multi-class classification model to predict the type of `"crop"` and identify the single most important feature for predictive performance.  *Note: I originally completed this small project through DataCamp.com. The site supplies, the topic, the data, a few questions, and checks the results are correct.  I supplied the analysis, results, and conclusions.
